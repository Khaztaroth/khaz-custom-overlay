# Custom Overlay for twitch

Run it with `npm start`

You can use the standalone chat overlay by going to `localhost:3000/chat` (or whichever url you end up using)
Set the channel by adding a `channel` header on your url, something like `localhost:3000/chat?channel=(CHANNEL)`

This project exists mostly to have a repository to use as reference, I struggled with finding something that did something similar
please dont' just use my overlays
